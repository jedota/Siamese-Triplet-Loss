# Siameses-Triple-Loss
Single-Morphing Attack Detection Using Few-Shot Learning and Triplet-Loss.
This is a joint effort of Juan E. Tapia, Daniel Schulz and Christoph Busch.

This work proposes to use a triplet-loss function to estimate the difficulties of each morphing tool and examine different pre-trained networks as a general framework solution. The experiments are conducted with four datasets: FERET, FRGCv2, open-source AMSL Morph, and the state-of-the-art "Synthetic-Face-Morphing-Attack-Detection-Development-dataset" (SMDD). Each one presents subsets of different morphing tools and conditions.

As an essential contribution, an FSL includes only a small number of examples from a new unknown dataset to guide the training process and increase the method's performance. These examples allow us to properly assign the different morphing tools and attacks.
